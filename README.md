# Introduction
Offered here are two scripts developed for the analysis of FISH signals, enabling the calculation of overlap or colocalisation between the signal in two channels, while using an additional channel to segment the cell's nucleus.
Detailed instructions on how to use the scripts will follow, for now feel free to shoot me a message.
